All of the source code (folders src and tools) belongs to me. Exceptions are citro2d and stb_sprintf and SDL_FontCache. Check each individual file for details.
All assets/art/content used in the project are based on Blizzard's Starcraft, I don't own their origial work.
You are free to use this project in any way that is not a commercial use, as long as a credit to this me and this repo is given.
I am not liable for any kind of damage, nor guarantee everything works.
Have fun.
